## Motivation

At my current job, I need access to numerous network resources at work, but obtaining exception approval from IT is frustrating due to:
* Repeatedly needing approval due to expiration, policy changes, or IP-related issues
* Difficulty tracking accessible resources and their varying justifications
* Resources being identified only by IP addresses, requiring assistance from senior employees

As a result, I built this small utility to keep make tracking network resources reachability easier.
